Enhanced Multimodal Studio with Multi-Agent Orchestrator Integration
Vision
Transform the Multimodal Studio into a comprehensive AI workspace that combines multi-modal content generation (text-to-image, text-to-speech, speech-to-text) with intelligent multi-agent orchestration, creating a powerful platform where AI agents can collaborate on complex multimodal tasks.

Core Integration Strategy
1. Enhanced Architecture
Add a fourth tab "Multi-Agent Hub" to the existing Multimodal Studio tabs
Create agent templates specialized for multimodal tasks (Image Generator Agent, Audio Processor Agent, Content Analyst Agent, etc.)
Integrate agents with the existing multimodal functions so they can autonomously generate images, audio, and process content
Add task templates for common multimodal workflows (e.g., "Create Marketing Campaign" = generate image + write copy + create audio narration)
2. Multimodal Agent Types
Visual Creator Agent: Specializes in image generation and manipulation using the existing text-to-image pipeline
Audio Specialist Agent: Handles text-to-speech, audio analysis, and transcription tasks
Content Strategist Agent: Analyzes multimodal content and provides recommendations
Quality Assurance Agent: Reviews generated content for consistency and quality
Workflow Coordinator Agent: Orchestrates complex multimodal projects
Analytics Agent: Tracks performance and provides insights on generated content
3. Enhanced Multimodal Features
Batch Processing: Agents can process multiple prompts/files simultaneously
Style Consistency: Agents maintain consistent styles across multiple generations
Content Pipelines: Automated workflows like "Blog Post → Image → Audio Narration"
Quality Control: Agents review and improve generated content
Template Library: Pre-built workflows for common use cases
Progress Tracking: Real-time monitoring of complex multimodal tasks
4. Advanced Orchestration Features
Task Dependencies: Link multimodal tasks (generate image first, then create audio description)
Parallel Processing: Multiple agents working on different aspects simultaneously
Resource Management: Smart allocation of generation resources
Error Handling: Agents retry failed generations with adjusted parameters
Learning System: Agents learn from successful patterns and user preferences
5. Intelligent Workflow Automation
Smart Templates: "Social Media Pack" (image + caption + hashtags + audio)
Brand Consistency: Agents maintain visual and audio brand guidelines
A/B Testing: Agents generate multiple variants for comparison
Performance Optimization: Agents adjust parameters based on results
Content Scheduling: Agents can queue and schedule content generation
6. Enhanced User Experience
Drag & Drop Workflow Builder: Visual workflow creation interface
Real-time Collaboration: Multiple agents working visibly in real-time
Progress Visualization: See agents working on different parts of projects
Smart Suggestions: Agents recommend improvements and optimizations
One-Click Templates: Start complex workflows with single clicks
